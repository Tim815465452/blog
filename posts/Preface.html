					<p>Well, I'm happy that I have succeeded it building my first own blog after typing over 90,000 characters. It was not a easy job for a high school student. But now I am proud that zsz12251665's has been published. All the themes, including the colours, the background images and the typesetting, were designed by myself just with a text editor, notepad++(In fact, this is because the WYSIWYG editors like Adobe Dreamweaver or Microsoft Word always change my codeform and make the indent a mess). It was a nice work, wasn't it? However, it was in HTML5 and CSS3 that I wrote the pages as static pages, so there are still some problems remain in the blog, such as different Chinese fonts can hardly to be used so that I have to use English in my blog instead of Chinese. As English is a foreign language to me, there must be some mistakes like grammar, spelling and expressions in my expressions. If you would like to contact me and point them out, I'll be really appreciate it. Thank you very much! </p>
