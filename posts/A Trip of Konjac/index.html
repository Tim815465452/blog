					<p>This post is about my first trip to GDOI(Guangdong Olympiad in Informatics). But you may have a problem with the title. Konjac is a kind of plant. Its Chinese name has a similar pronunciation with another Chinese word which means "immensely weak" in English. So most of us called ourselves konjac to show that we are very weak. </p>
					<p>GDOI 2017 was held from April 28th(Friday) to May 2nd(Tuesday). On the sunny Friday afternoon, we got on the coach and left for Dongguan at 15:00. To my surprise, the Guangzhou Tieyi Middle School(hereinafter referred to as Tieyi for short) was also there, taking the same bus with us. I had heard of that Tieyi was facing a big problem that they are having fewer and fewer students who was interested in informatics. They only sent a contestant, Tan Jiawei, and a coach called Mr. Lu Jianfeng to attend GDOI this year since there were no students in the Senior Grade 1 was interested in these things. I had met Tan during the lessons last winter holiday. He is silent, but very good at Informatics. But I had known little about his coach. So I sat at the chair behind the two coaches. The other one is the coach of the junior high school, Mr. Yao Xiaohao, who is also the brother of the coach of Shantou Jinshan Middle School(hereinafter referred to as Jinshan for short), Ms. Yao Xiaohua. The 1.5-hour travel was boring. So I spent the time listening to the talk of the two coaches. They talked about the strained relationship between the electrifying education teachers and the informatics teachers, the embarrassing status of the informatics teachers, how to teach the students informatics and so on. What was funny is when they talked about some teachers treat the informatics teachers as who are able to repair their computers, I joined their talk and told them my experience when I was in Guangzhou Wuyang Middle School. I needed to repair the computers, making presentations for our class teacher and do something else that is not related to informatics in fact. After the talk, my words had made a deep impression on him. At least I thought so. </p> 
					<p>At about 16:30, we arrived at the hotel in which we were going to stay in the next 5 days. The Room 1119 was big, clean and comfortable, which I was very satisfied with. 30 minutes later, we took another coach for dinner to the TungWah Senior High School Songshan Lake (Ecological Park) Campus, which would be the place the hold GDOI 2017. In the next 4 days, we would run on the road times and times would be busy with moving between the hotel and the school. It is really a huge school. It looks that the teaching buildings, the office building, the dormitory buildings, even the canteen are all much larger than ours. The dinner was like buffet, but less dishes for you to choose. Since we spent some moments taking photos at the front door, the queue in front of us was very long. Maybe I need to get here earlier to avoid waiting so long like this. After returning to the hotel, we just did some personal things and then went to bed. This is the day 0. </p>
					<p>I think it was about 05:50 when I almost rolled down to the floor. And then I found it 10 minutes before my alarm. So I decided to get up. And I also woke up another student in my room called He Junjie, a junior high student of our school. At 06:30, we came to the 2nd floor for breakfast. The western buffet was good. I had a good breakfast here. The ham, bread and juice tasted yummy that I ate a lot. At about 08:00, I arrived at my computer room. What was out of my expectation was the host almost provided us with everything, even including some Snickers and a bottle of water. The Day 1 Contest began in 30 minutes. The first problem was about substring replacing, and the key part is how to find the substring. I knew nothing about the string function of C++, so I used Pascal instead. There is a function called pos in Pascal. It can find the first appeared place of a specific substring in another string. So I used it to find the substring. The second one was a long problem. The description was over 2,000 characters long(There was another document which kept the complete description, which had over 5,300 characters). I spent a long time comprehending what was asked to do. The true task was to find the minimum natural number excluding the set of the weights of the subtree and itself of every node of a tree. So a BFS(Breadth First Search) was used to solve it. The third problem is a problem of asking the longest common substring of a string with deletion. However, I paid no attention to the problem. The last one was a mathematical problem. It was about the number of the ways of the triangulation of polygon. I spent the rest of time trying to find out the formula of it. But I didn't make it. After the lunch at school and the noon break in the hotel, we went back to school for the solution and communication meeting of the problems in Day 1. The first Problem required KMP(Knuth-Morris-Pratt string searching algorithm) to solve. The second one was not as easy as BFS. But I forgot the solution was the segment tree or the tree chain division. The third problem was similar from the longest common substring. The last problem was much harder than I expected. It was related to Catalan Number(but I had no idea with what it is). And it also required NTT(Number Theoretic Transforms) and FFT(Fast Fourier Transform), which I hadn't learned. Because there were some problem about the wrong data of the second problem. The mark was given later. I only got 20 on the first problem. By the way, we went to a store close to the hotel after dinner, and bought a lot of snacks. They are really delicious. </p>
					<p>Day 2 was similar to Day 1. The only difference is the problem was different. The first problem is to search the shortest path from point to point. Since I didn't know how to use struct node, so I gave up the BFS with queue and used DFS(Depth First Search) instead. The second problem was to compare several binary numbers. There was no doubt that the only way was simulate and the O(n^2) must be the time complexity of the algorithm. So I compared every pair of them bit by bit. The third problem was to sort the sequence with the fewest steps. I didn't know what to do. So I searched the problem string with the order of the answer string. I knew that it had some loophole, but I wish it can earn me a little more. In the afternoon, the solution of the first problem was the BFS based on the time order(I didn't think of the time order, but I thought the BFS) or SPFA(the Shortest Path Faster Algorithm). The solution of the second one was similar to what I thought. But the constant can be reduced by cutting the 64-bit number into several groups. The third one required an algorithm similar to find LCS(the Longest Common Subsequence). The last problem was a fantastic data structure which was persistent. I got 30 on the first problem and 5 on the third problem. What's more, the contest committee changed the time limit of the first problem and the data of the second problem of Day 1, so I earned 20 more on the second problem. By the way, my parents came to visit me in the late afternoon. We had dinner in Shilong, Dongguan. But I preferred to spend my time with my friends. Some of them may have no more chance to attend GDOI again. </p>
					<p>After two-day's constant, the highest 70 students would be able to attend Day 3, which is called GDSOI(Guangdong team Selected Olympiad in Informatics). Wang Huaijie in Senior Grade 1, who was one of the best contestants in our school, Ma Zailin in Senior Grade 2, another contestant from our school who didn't make huge mistakes these days, as well as Tan had the chance to attend. The rest of the contestants would go to visit some place in Dongguan. We visited an environment-friendly power station, which burns the rubbish to produce electricity with little smoke. Then we had a walk in the Ecological Park. After the lunch, we spent a boring afternoon in the hotel. Huang Kang'en, whose home was in Zhaoqing, a city beside Dongguan, went back home by bike. His parents sent him back by car in the late evening. Long Hanzhe had returned to Guangzhou in the evening of Day 2. Zhan Fangrong, Fang Decheng, Wu Yuheng and Bao Zhengheng also left in the afternoon. Mao Hongxi and Liu Che spent a whole day in their room playing computer games. Ma didn't go to attend the meeting of Day 3 and he also missed the coach to the school at supper time. So only Liang Jingcong and I and the junior high students went to the school for dinner. After our return, I came to Ma's room and play computer games with him for a while. I helped him clear the Tomb Raider. At about 23:00, Yao Xiaohao asked us to go downstairs to play the killer games. So we came to the Room 515. When we got in, I was surprise to find that some students of our school, including three junior high students and three senior high students, Tan, some students from Jinshan, and the teacher of these three schools are all here. We had a good night there. We played and played until 02:30 in the next day. What's funny was that Mr. Yao took a photo of us and sent in to the Moments of Wechat. Then he found that one of his friends said the photo was as same as the live of anti-sex because there was a girl sitting on the bed with quilt on her knees and a boy lying on the bed! The teachers and junior high students went back at 01:00. Someone like Huang Kang'en and Liang Jingcong also left at about 01:30. After I went back to my room, I found that He Ruijie had fallen asleep. So I also went to bed at 02:45. </p>
					<p>Then the last day of GDOI 2017 has arrived. 3 hours and a quarter later, I got up. After packing my bags(I took 2 bags), I came down for breakfast at 06:30. Mr. Yao seemed having a bad sleep last night. At 08:00, we finished the last breakfast. He went back to sleep. At 08:50, we came to the first floor and wait for him to go to the school last time for the awards ceremony. But he didn't appear. Then we met Ms Yao. She called her brother and found him still sleeping! At 10:00, everything was ready and the ceremony began. This is the first time I saw the Dr Guo Songshan, the leader of GDOI for 32 years. He isn't tall, just like an ordinary old man. I used to dream that he is a tall man with white hair! But anyway that was just my imagination. Wang got the second prize, Tan, Fang, Ma, Liang, Huang, Wu and maybe more students got the third prize. We took a group photo at the front door of the school, the school where we spent 5 days. Then a bus came to take us back to the hotel for the closing lunch. On the way back, I thought of our last meeting. Some of the ones who took part the killer game next time was on Senior Grade 2. This was their last GDOI. I might not meet them anymore. What a pity! But before the lunch was over, we can still enjoy the rest of the time. The lunch was delicious, but it seemed that there were too many dishes that we cannot eat them up. Over half on them still remained. After the lunch, I took on my bag and went back home at 13:00. I had asked Mr. Yao to leave on Day 3 because they planned to leave at 14:30, which might be too late to go back home for me. And I decided to go to the train station by bus and then take a train to Guangzhou. But just when I got out the lift, I found Tan standing in the lobby with his bag and trunk. I went to ask him why he was there. He explained that he was going to go back to Guangzhou with Mr. Lu. At the moment, Mr. Lu came along. He recognized me and asked me why I was there. I said I was going to the train station and go back to Guangzhou. He was surprised that I was going to go back alone, so he asked me to go back with him. After some polite words, I agreed(Why not reduce the cost of the ticket? ). So we took the car of Guangzhou Science and Technology Association to get back. Who could predict that something like this would happen? 2 hours later, Tan and I arrived the Yuexiu Park and took the metro home ourselves. And that's end of the trip of my first GDOI. </p>
